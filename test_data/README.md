# Prompt Folder

This repository contains a collection of prompts used in experiments for analysing the performance of various language models on the SciQA benchmark. Each model has its own subfolder containing the prompts specific to that model.

## Models

### T5-Base
- Folder: `01-t5-base`
- Description: There is only one file containing all the prompts employed for the T5-base.

### GPT 2
- Folder: `02-gpt-2`
- Description: This folder holds 13 files (one for each experiment) containing all the prompts we employed for the GPT 2 model.

### Dolly
- Folder: `03-dolly-v2-3B`
- Description: This folder holds 20 files (one for each experiment) containing all the prompts we employed for the Dolly model.
  This folder contains ```test_3``` which is the preliminary output of the test 3.

### GPT 3.5
- Folder: `04-gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Description: This folder holds 16 files (one for each experiment) containing all the prompts we employed for the GPT 3.5 model.

## Usage
- You can access the prompts for each model to replicate the experiments conducted in the study.
- The prompts are organized by model for easy reference and reproducibility.
