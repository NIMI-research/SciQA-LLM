Therefore, better management of blood glucose (BG) is of paramount importance for preventing cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients.

Higher frequency of BG excursions (deltaBG) is strongly associated with diabetes-related complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. [13-15]\\nHyperglycemia and increased BG variability are intimately related, although the specific mechanism is unknown. Elevated BG levels were repeatedly associated with greater BG variability.

Tubulin can be activated to polymerize into microtubules by adding GTP. GTP and tubulin bind to form a GTP-tubulin dimer that can phosphorylate and polymerize into microtubules upon removal of the GTP nucleotide. This phosphorylation reaction may be regulated by a GTP-GDP cycle mechanism involving a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that interacts with the beta-subunits of tubulin and binds the alpha- and beta-subunits as a dimer. The protein purified to apparent homogeneity from chick brain bound three equivalents of GDP per tubulin dimer, with subsequent loss of bound GDP activity upon treatment of the protein with ATP. With the purified protein, only one subunit of alpha-tubulin was phosphorylated. With a crude mixture of tubulin and a MAP purified from rabbit brain that bound two equivalents of GDP per tubulin dimer, both alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits were phosphorylated.

This offers an attractive therapeutic strategy; depleting, re-establishing or modulating the activity of the gene product may be effective in treating the disease. For example, specific gene products have been identified which are effective in suppressing the growth of tumor cells, and therefore can be used to treat cancer patients. However, the development of effective gene therapeutic agents which are safe and effective against humans remains a challenging and important goal.\\nEfforts to develop safe and effective therapeutic agents have focused on achieving maximal expression from the introduced genes in target cells. In this regard, safe and effective means that the expression of the introduced genes does not cause significant toxic effects in the patient, while still being sufficient to achieve the therapeutic effect. In addition, the means of achieving this expression must be as simple as possible and easily scaleable to manufacture on a large scale.\\nTranscription of foreign genes in eukaryotic cells requires the formation of a complex containing'}], [{'generated_text': '_Atari 2600 Freeway_Benchmark { \"model\": \"diveintomark.atari_b \\'Atari 2600 Freeway\\'\", \"benchmark\": \"Number of frames per second (fps)\"}, 38.79180438060151\\n input (English text): 1.
